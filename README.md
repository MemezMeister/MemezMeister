      <td valign="text-top">This top-down space-themed shooter challenges players to beat their highest round, with WASD controls and automatic shooting. A dice roll system determines enemy spawns and buffs, creating a random and dynamic experience. Players face increasing difficulty as more enemies spawn with each round, and they can collect buffs after defeating enemies, which may boost fire rate, heal, increase max HP, or enhance damage based on another dice roll.</td> <!--desc-->
      <td valign="text-top">This Space Invader game is similar to the classic arcade version, with the player's ship controlled using A and D keys. The enemy behavior resembles a top-down shooter, using a dice roll system for shooting. Initially, all enemies have a base shooting difficulty of 1, and though I considered increasing the difficulty, it made the game too hard. Now, enemies only shoot when they roll a 1, but even so, many enemies can still fire at the player.</td> <!--desc-->
